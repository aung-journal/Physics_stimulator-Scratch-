# Title: Scratch Physics Simulator Game
# Objective:

The primary goal of the Scratch Physics Simulator Game is to provide an engaging and educational experience for users, particularly aimed at young learners. The objectives of the project include:

    Educational Focus:
        Introduce basic physics principles in an interactive and entertaining way.
        Encourage hands-on exploration and experimentation with various physics concepts.
        Foster understanding of fundamental principles such as friction, gravity, collisions, and other forces.

    Game Dynamics:
        Implement a level-based structure to gradually introduce and reinforce different physics elements.
        Offer challenges and scenarios that prompt users to observe, infer, and apply physics concepts in a simulated environment.
        Create a user-friendly interface with clear instructions to facilitate an intuitive learning experience.

    Customization and Adaptability:
        Allow users to customize and modify simulation parameters to encourage creativity and curiosity.
        Provide adaptability for different age groups by offering varying levels of complexity and detail in the physics simulations.
        Track user progress and provide feedback to enhance the learning experience.

# Materials:

To run the Scratch Physics Simulator Game, the following materials are required:

    Hardware:
        A computer or tablet with internet access to run the Scratch online editor (https://scratch.mit.edu).
        Input device, such as a mouse or touchpad, for interaction with the Scratch interface.
